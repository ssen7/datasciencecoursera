# Instructions for using this script

* Keep the data set in a folder called "GCDataset".
* Keep the script in the same directory as the "GCDataset" folder.
* Run the script using source run_analysis.R.
* Voila!

 You should have two new text files data-gc.txt and data-table-final.txt

* data-gc.txt contains the tidy data set with the means of the all the variables for specific activities like WALKING, STANDING, etc.

* data-table-final.txt contains the data after we combine the data for the test and training sets. Looks much better and contains descriptive column names.
